# digital_stethoscope
Digital stethoscope made with the arduino uno. Inputs analog signals and converts it to digital signal which is filtered to isolate the heartbeats. A peak detection algorithm is then used to set a threshold for distinguishing each individual heartbeat. To adjust the value or the gain, use the peak detection test code.
